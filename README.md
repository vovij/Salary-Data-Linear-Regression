# Salary prediction using Linear Regression
This notebook contains a linear regression analysis of a Salary prediction data from Kaggle. The dataset contains only 30 records of the data in 2 columns, years of working experience and corresponding salary. Short exploratory analysis was firstly done on the dataset to see the general distribution with pandas, after which the data was visualized using seaborn and matplotlib libraries. The linear regression was then fit to the data, residuals calculated and compared to the mean salary values. The distribution of the data was then checked using the histograms and QQ plots. However, due to the small amount of data that is given in the dataset, the information about the distribution of the couldn't be accurately assessed. Given model fits the data quite well, howecer, more data is needed to give an adequate estimation of the linear model performance in such scenario.
